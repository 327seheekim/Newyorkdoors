                                Embrace the Unknown

                                In shadows deep and mysteries concealed,
                                Lies the realm where the heart is truly revealed.
                                Where courage ignites and fear must be overthrown,
                                This is the place where we must venture, alone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With every step into the great unknown,
                                A path unmarked, but we are not alone.
                                For in our souls, a fire brightly grown,
                                Guiding us forward, into the great unknown.
                            </p>  
                            <p>
                                The stars above, they twinkle and they tease,
                                Beckoning us to explore, to chase, to seize.
                                In the vast expanse, where dreams are sown,
                                We find our purpose, into the unknown we're thrown.
                            </p> 
                                <p>
                                Though uncertainty may cast its heavy shroud,
                                And doubts within us whisper, speaking loud,
                                We'll march with hearts both bold and stoned,
                                To conquer the darkness of the unknown.
                            </p> 
                            <p>  
                                For it's in the journey where we truly learn,
                                The wisdom we gain at every twist and turn.
                                Each step we take, a lesson brightly honed,
                                As we embrace the beauty of the unknown.
                            </p> 
                                <p>  
                                So, fear not the uncharted, the depths, the heights,
                                In the unknown, our spirits take their flights.
                                With every challenge, our strength is grown,
                                As we find our way, into the great unknown.
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                Embrace the unknown, let your spirit soar,
                                Discover the treasures, both near and far ashore.
                                In the realm of possibilities, you'll find your own,
                                As you step forward boldly, into the unknown.
